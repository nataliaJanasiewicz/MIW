### Knowledge engineering methods (Metody in≈ºynierii wiedzy)
* Project 1 - Rock Paper Scissors - Markov chain
* Project 2 - Classification tasks - perceptron, logistic regression
* Project 3 - Check tree operation for entropy and Gini coefficient
* Project 4 - Linear parametric model and non-linear regression model
* Project 5 - Neural network with non-linear activation function
* Project 6 - Convolutional network with various activation functions.
* Project 8 - Extend the convolutional network from project 6 to the autocoder by adding symmetrical Conv2DTranspose layers
